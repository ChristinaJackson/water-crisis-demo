          <p>
            I'm Louis Williams. Long ago around the 1980s, a friend of mine was
            studying civil engineering and we began discussing how water
            infrastructure in most American cities have old systems. The pipes
            were laid in early in the century and were made of lead. We knew
            back then that lead was dangerous to ingest at any level.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to buy 5-gallon bottles of filtered water but it did not
            take me long before I realized that I was still taking a risk by
            purchasing filtered water. I learned most filters failed to clean
            water efficiently. It made me feel safe that I could make distilled
            water and monitor that process to ensure it was safe to drink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I believe having the convenience of not lugging around large
            gallon water bottles was great! My niece, Anura, and I saw this was
            another concept that would aid the folks in Flint to have a little
            more control over their lives. We want people to know that we are
            still watching and we care. We have not forgotten about Flint.
          </p>
